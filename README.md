### What is Component Size Masuarer?
Component Size Masuarer is a tool for outlining a component in any
website. It's helpful to outline any size of component.

### Why should you use this?
Being a web developer myself, I can become irritated with the component size that I'm talking about at times. You can measure the size of the reference component with this tool.
